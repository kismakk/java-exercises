/*
 * Exercise 2: Method Overriding
 * 
 * 1. Create a class named Shape with a two attributes: base and height, and a method named calculateArea that returns the area of the shape.
 * 2. Create a class named Triangle that extends Shape and overrides the calculateArea method.
 * 3. Create a class named Trapezoid that extends Shape and overrides the calculateArea method. The Trapezoid class should have an additional attribute named topBase.
 * 4. In the main method, create instances of Triangle and Rectangle and call the calculateArea method.
 * 
 * Research the formula for calculating the area of a triangle and a trapezoid.
