/*
 * Exercise 2: Multilevel Inheritance
 * 
 * Extend the previous exercise by creating a new class named 'GraduateStudent' that inherits from 'Student'.
 *    - Add two new attributes: 'thesisTitle' and 'graduationYear'.
 *    - Include a constructor to initialize all attributes (name, age, studentID, thesisTitle, graduationYear).
 *    - Create a method 'displayGraduateStudentInfo()' to display all attributes in the format: "Name: [name], Age: [age], Student ID: [studentID], Thesis Title: [thesisTitle], Graduation Year: [graduationYear]".
 * 
 * Expected Output:
 * 
 * Name: John, Age: 35
 * 
 * Name: Jane, Age: 20
 * Student ID: 12345
 * 
 * Name: Mary, Age: 25
 * Student ID: 67890
 * Thesis Title: "The Art of Testing"
 * Graduation Year: 2022
