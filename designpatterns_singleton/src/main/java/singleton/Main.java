/*
 * Exercise: In-Memory Logging System with Singleton Pattern
 * 
 * You're developing an in-memory logging system for a multi-threaded application. 
 * You want to ensure that only one instance of the logger exists throughout the application to prevent resource conflicts and maintain a single, consistent log.
 * 
 * Exercise Requirements:
 * 
 *  - Implement a Logger class using the Singleton pattern.
 *  - The Logger should have methods to log messages at different levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
 *  - Ensure thread-safety for the Singleton implementation.
 *  - Use an ArrayList to store log messages in memory.
