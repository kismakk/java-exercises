/*
 * Exercise 1: Box Exercise
 * 
 * Add the following private attributes to the Box class: length, width, and height. 
 * Also create methods to calculate surface are, lateral surface area, and volume of the box. Name them calculateSurfaceArea, calculateLateralSurfaceArea, and calculateVolume, respectively.
 * 
 * Make sure the constructor doesn't directly set the attributes. Add private setters for each attribute that also validate the input. If the input is invalid,
 * throw an IllegalArgumentException with the message "Length cannot be zero or negative." (or width or height, depending on the attribute).
 * 
 * Formulas for the calculations: http://www.mathwords.com/r/rectangular_parallelepiped.htm
