# Java Programming exercises

A collection of programming exercises written in Java.

## About

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises written in Java. The exercises are divided into different categories, such as OOP, design patterns, and more. Each exercise contains a description of the problem, solution, and tests. The exercises are for a Java programming course in Oulu University of Applied Sciences starting in autumn 2024.

At the moment the objective is to create the exercises, and later upload them to the courses Moodle. In the future I plan to write a local test runner so people are able to clone the repository, try solving the exercises, and run the tests locally to see if their solution is correct.
