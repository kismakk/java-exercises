/*
 * Exercise: Game Character Factory
 * 
 * You're developing a simple role-playing game (RPG) where players can create different types of characters. 
 * Each character type has unique attributes and abilities.
 * 
 * Your task is to implement a character creation system using the Factory Method pattern. 
 * The system should be able to create different types of characters (Warrior, Mage, and Archer) without specifying their exact classes.
 * 
 * TODO: Make a UML diagram for exercise
