/*
 * Exercise: Working with Lists
 * 
 * Create a program that manages a list of student names. The program should be able to:
 * 
 *  - Add a student to the list (addStudent)
 *  - Remove a student from the list by id (removeStudent)
 *  - Display the list of students (displayStudents)
 *  - Find a student by name (findStudent)
 * 
 * Create a class Student with a name and id property that will be used to store the student information. Then create a class called StudentManager that will manage the list of students.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * StudentManager students = new StudentManager();
 * 
 * Student student1 = new Student("John Doe", "S1234");
 * Student student2 = new Student("Jane Doe", "S5678");
 * 
 * students.addStudent(student1);
 * students.addStudent(student2);
 * 
 * students.displayStudents(); // Output: Name: John Doe, ID: S1234, Name: Jane Doe, ID: S5678
 * students.findStudent("John Doe"); // Output: Name: John Doe, ID: S1234
 * students.removeStudent("S5678");
 * 
 * students.displayStudents(); // Output: Name: John Doe, ID: S1234
